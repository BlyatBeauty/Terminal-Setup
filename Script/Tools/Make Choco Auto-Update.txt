ChocoUpdate:

To have chocolatey update automatically, you're gonna wanna do 2 things: Set up automatic package updates and Fix Choco's annoying desktop icon habit

Set up automatic package updates:

1) Open Task Scheduler and make a new basic task
2) Make it run daily at whatver time you wish
3) The action will be Run a Program;
4) The program you'll be running is either PowerShell.exe or pwsh.exe (If you installed the most recent version of PowerShell, which like, you totally should.)
5) The argument for the program will be 
-Command "choco upgrade all -y"
6) In the Creat a Basic Task menu, near the end, you'll have the option to "Open Properties after finishing"
7) In Properties, on the first page, you'll have a box to check titled "Run with highest privileges"
